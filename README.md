# Installation Instructions

## Mac

Make sure you have Python3 installed, as well as pip. This should hopefully not be necessary when this is wrapped in a Docker image.

## Windows

Enable Windows Subystem for Linux, and use Bash in a terminal in VS Code so that I can work on both my laptop and my MacBook. Make a small blog post about this cross-platform compatibility (or wrap it in Docker?)
